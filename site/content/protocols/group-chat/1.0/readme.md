## Summary
The DIDComm Group Chat protocol supports message exchange between a group of individuals or a group comprised of an organization and 1 or more of its community members. A `Group Chat` conversation is a collection of text or media messages sorted as a time series. Unlike the `BasicMessage` or `Conversation` protocols that constrain participation to pairwise connections, the `Group Chat` protocol supports secure end-to-end message exchange between Group Chat participants that may not all have direct trusted connections between.

## Motivation
Conversational text messaging is a type of digital interaction that most internet users are familiar with. There is a wide array of messaging apps readily available to support private and public conversation messaging between individuals and/or organizations. Unlike most of the messaging tools available today, the `Group Chat` protocol enables conversational messaging between a groups of individuals and/or organizations over DIDComm without requiring the use of privacy invasive identifiers such as phone numbers or email addresses.

### Name and Version

This is the Group Chat protocol. It is uniquely identified by the URI:

    "https://didcomm.org/group-chat/1.0"

## Roles

This protocol defines the roles of `participant`, `administrator` and `controller` to support Group Chat message and participant meta-data coordination.

- `administrator`: A person or organization entity that initiates and administers a Group Chat conversation. The `administrator` delegates protocol activities to its corresponding `controller` agent.
- `participant`: An agent participating in a Group Chat conversation. 
- `controller`: The agent that processes protocol activities initiated by a Group Chat administrator. The `controller` can initiate a Group Chat conversation by triggering an invitation request message to a group of connected parties. The `controller` also forwards `received` conversation messages to group chat participants.


## Connectivity
The `controller` participant must have a connection with the collection of participants initially invited to join the conversation. A `participant` must have a DIDComm connection to the `controller` participant but may not be connected to all of the participants.

## Basic Walkthrough

### group-chat-invitation
A Group Chat conversation is initiated when an `administrator` user sends an initial message to a group of active connections. The administrator's `controller` agent iterates through each connection and creates an [Out-of-Band](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#out-of-band-messages) invitation used to establish a private Group Chat messaging channel between the `controller` and `participant` agents. The `controller` agent emits a `group-chat-invitation` protocol message to each `participant` connection. The `group-chat-invitation` message includes meta-data about the Group Chat including a Group Chat identifier `ConversationId`, a human-readable participant identifier `ParticipantAlias` and the Out-of-Band invitation URL `oobUrl`. 

![group-chat-invitation sub-protocol](./role_GroupAdministrator.png)

Each `participant` agent in the group receives the `group-chat-invitation` message and presents the invitation request to the holder. If the holder chooses to accept the invitation request, the `participant` agent initiates a [DID Exchange](https://didcomm.org/didexchange/1.1/) with the Group Chat's `controller` agent. The `controller` agent negotiates a pairwise DID connection with the `participant` agent and once the connection reaches a `completed` or `active` state, emits a `group-chat-message` with the contents of the Group Chat's initial message.

### group-chat-message
The Group Chat's `controller` agent or any one of the group `participant` agents can emit a `group-chat-message` protocol message. When an `administrator` participant sends a new message to the group, the `controller` agent must iterate through each of the `active` participants and emit a `group-chat-message`. In the case where a `participant` sends a new message to the group, the `participant` agent emits a `group-chat-message` to the `controller` agent delegating to it the responsibility of `forwarding` the message contents to the rest of the group. To `forward` the received message, the `controller` agent must iterate through each of the `active` participants (omitting the message `sender`) and emit a `group-chat-message` with the message contents.

### group-chat-participant-profile
By design, there is no personally identifying information (PII) shared between the group chat participants. The Group Chat `controller` does assign a participant `alias` (a human-readable pseudonymous identifier) to each `participant` that is used to identify the group participants. The `group-chat-participant-profile` enables a `participant` to change the participant `alias` and broadcast the change to the group via the `controller` agent path. To `forward` the received message, the `controller` agent must iterate through each of the `active` participants (omitting the message `sender`) and emit a `group-chat-participant-profile` with the updated participant meta-data.


## Messages
### group-chat-invitation Request Message
The protocol begins when the `controller` sends a `group-chat-invitation` message to a group of connections:

### group-chat-message Message

A Group Chat message is broadcast to all group chat participants if authored by the `administrator`. If authored by a `participant`, the group chat message is sent to the `controller` which then forwards the message to group participants on behalf of the author.

DIDComm V1 Example:
```json
{
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/group-chat/1.0/message",
    "@id": "c13002c5-3712-4901-9287-6dc9e248a95f",
